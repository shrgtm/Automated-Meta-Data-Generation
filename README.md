Project Name: Automated Metadata Generation Web App
Introduction
This project is a complete web application built using Python. Its purpose is to help people automatically generate metadata from different types of documents. Metadata is important information about a document, like the title, keywords, summary, author, and date. Normally, this kind of information is added manually, but this app uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create it automatically.

The web app allows you to upload a file, and it instantly reads the content inside that file and generates metadata. This is useful for researchers, students, librarians, and anyone who deals with a large number of documents and needs a better way to organize or understand them.

What This App Does
It lets you upload a document from your computer.

It reads the content of that document using Python.

If the document is an image, it uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read the text.

It then summarizes the content using an AI model.

It extracts keywords from the summary.

It creates a clean and readable metadata structure.

It displays the metadata on a simple website.

Why This App Is Useful
Manually summarizing and tagging documents is time-consuming. This app does it for you automatically and accurately. You can use it to:

Quickly understand the content of any document

Save time in organizing or classifying files

Prepare documents for search indexing

Tag research papers or scanned notes

Create content summaries for archives or libraries

How the App Works
The user opens the website in a browser.

The user uploads a file. The file can be a PDF, Word document, plain text file, or even an image.

The app extracts the text from the uploaded file.

The app uses an AI model to analyze and summarize the text.

Based on the summary, it automatically generates metadata like:

Title

Summary

Keywords

Author (default is "Unknown")

Date (default is "Unknown")

The metadata is shown directly on the website.

File Types That Are Supported
This app can work with the following types of files:

PDF files (.pdf)

Word documents (.docx)

Plain text files (.txt)

Image files like JPEG and PNG (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)

Each of these files is processed in a slightly different way. For example, text is extracted directly from PDF and Word files, but images are passed through OCR to detect text inside them.

How It Was Built
This app was created using Python and Flask for the web backend. Here are some tools and libraries used:

Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python. It runs the web server and handles file uploads and web requests.

pytesseract: A Python library for OCR (Optical Character Recognition). It helps read text from image files.

pdfplumber: This is used to extract text from PDF files.

python-docx: This is used to extract text from Microsoft Word (.docx) files.

transformers: This is a powerful AI library from HuggingFace. It is used here to summarize the content of the documents.

Pillow: This is used for image processing.

torch: This is used to support the AI model for summarization.

All of these tools work together to make the app read your file, understand it, and generate the metadata.

Website Structure
The project consists of a Python script that runs a server and an HTML page that acts as the user interface. Here is a quick overview of the files:

app.py: This is the main script. It runs the web app, handles uploads, processes the files, and returns the results.

templates/index.html: This is the website itself. It includes a file upload form and displays the results.

uploads/: This is the folder where uploaded files are stored temporarily during processing.

Example of What You See After Uploading
Once you upload a file, youâ€™ll see metadata like this on your screen:

Title: Introduction to Deep Learning
Summary: This document explains deep learning, covering neural networks, activation functions, and training techniques used in real-world AI systems.
Keywords: deep, learning, neural, networks, AI, model
Author: Unknown
Date: Unknown

Who Can Use This
This app can be useful for:

Researchers and students summarizing long academic papers

Librarians and archivists tagging scanned books or articles

Developers building smarter document search tools

Content writers or editors preparing summaries

Teachers organizing student assignments

No programming knowledge is needed to use the app once it is running.

What Can Be Improved in the Future
Here are some ideas to make the app better in the future:

Let users download the metadata as a file

Let users copy the metadata with one click

Detect author and date automatically if they are mentioned in the document

Support more file types like Excel or HTML

Save and display history of uploaded files

Conclusion
This project helps automate the boring task of reading, understanding, and tagging documents. With just a simple upload, you can get a clear overview of any file. It uses the power of Python and AI to make document handling smarter and easier.
